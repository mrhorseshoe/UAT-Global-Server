# Changelog

## 16/07/2026
- **Automated spark reroll**: new tickbox plus a Spark Reroll Options popup (desired blue/pink sparks and a minimum star count). The bot rerolls when no desired spark is present and picks the better set on the Spark Selection screen; if neither set qualifies it keeps the one with more white sparks.
- **Spark reroll carats option**: optional toggle to spend a TP item/carats to restore TP when a career ends with too little to afford a reroll (default off keeps the original sparks). Also fixed the bot getting stuck on the "Restore TP?" prompt when short on TP.
